# Agora forum
A basic PHP/MySQL powered forum system with a minimal storage footprint.

Test out or discuss Agora forum here: https://agora.evalyn.app/

## Features
 - Uncomplicated code (No unexplained regex, things are generally written in a pretty straightforward manner)
 - All features supported without Javascript (Javascript still enhances some features)
 - Powerful BBCode parser written specifically for Agora (No regex used. Very straightforward to edit.)
 - Optional email address confirmation system
 - Private messaging system
 - Lack of feature bloat (or just an excuse as to this list being short)

## To-do
 - Add boards  
 - Add more admin tools and improve existing ones  
 - Overhaul visual design
 - Search feature
